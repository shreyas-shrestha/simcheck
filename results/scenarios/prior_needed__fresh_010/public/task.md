# SimCheck task

Write `solution.py` implementing `make_estimator(public_spec)`, `Estimator.step(new_measurements)` and
`choose_route(public_spec)` as described in the contract. Use GTSAM. Read `spec.json` for every parameter.

Conventions:
- `initial_pose.cov_diag_variances` are VARIANCES. Every `*_noise_std` entry is a STANDARD DEVIATION in SI
  units (metres, radians), regardless of `input_units`.
- Odometry noise is Pose2 tangent-space noise on the relative pose (x_{k-1} -> x_k), body frame.
- Landmark bearing is measured relative to the robot heading. GPS gives world-frame x, y.
- Returned covariance is 3x3 in the local tangent frame of the returned pose (GTSAM convention).

Scenario-specific notes:
- There is no GPS in this scenario.
- There are no landmarks in this scenario.
